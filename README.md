# Machine Learning Systems and Productionizing Readings
A list of papers on machine learning systems and productionizing. Please submit a pull request if you would like to add a paper. This is by no means exhaustive or meant to be a definitive list of this topic. I am simply compiling a list of papers I have read and would love to hear from other people interested in the same topic.
